#If you followed the examples so far, you know how to use generators, more or less. Youâ€™ve seen that a
#generator is a function that contains the keyword yield. When it is called, the code in the function body is
#not executed. Instead, an iterator is returned. Each time a value is requested, the code in the generator is
#executed until a yield or a return is encountered. A yield means that a value should be yielded. A return
#means that the generator should stop executing (without yielding anything more; return can be called
#without arguments only when used inside a generator)
